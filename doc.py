    #### A poetry generator using AI is a program or model that uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to create original poems. The AI model is trained on a large corpus of existing poems to learn the patterns, structures, and language used in poetry.
    ####The model can then generate new poems based on the input prompt given by the user. The generated poems can be structured in various forms such as sonnets, haikus, or free verse, and can mimic the style and tone of famous poets or be entirely unique. 
    #### It is developed with deep learning network using LSTM encoder decoder architecture.
